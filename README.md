I made this when I was 12 to farm in game codes from a stream to sell them online

I was making $300 perday of of ebay, by the time it was over i made over 2k in a weeks period. The bot eventually malfunctioned and all bots were banned. The game was Brawlhalla. Ever since the bots were banned the company shut down the stream and developed different methodes of giving out the codes.
